 * <p/>
 * Given a set of ontologies, this composite change will convert all property assertion
 * axioms whose subject is a 'punned' individual (i.e. an individual that shares a name
 * with a class), removes these axioms and replaces them with annotations on the class
 * that shares the same name as the individual.  For example for a class A and an individual
 * A, the data property assertion hasX(A, "Val") would be converted to an entity annotation on
 * the class A with an annotation URI of "hasX" and a value of "Val".
 * <p/>
 * This composite change supports refactoring an ontology where punning was used to simulate
 * annotations on a class rather than using actual annotations on a class.
