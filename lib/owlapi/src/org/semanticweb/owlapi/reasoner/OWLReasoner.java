/**
 * Author: Matthew Horridge<br> The University of Manchester<br> Information Management Group<br>
 * Date: 21-Jan-2009
 * <p>
 * An OWLReasoner reasons over a set of axioms (the set of reasoner axioms) that is based on the imports closure of a
 * particular ontology - the "root" ontology.  This ontology can be obtained using the {@link OWLReasoner#getRootOntology()} method.
 * When the client responsible for creating the reasoner has finished with the
 * reasoner instance it must call the {@link #dispose()} method to free any resources that are used by the reasoner.
 * In general, reasoners should not be instantiated directly, but should be created using the appropriate
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.OWLReasonerFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Ontology Change Management (Buffering and Non-Buffering Modes)</h2>
 * At creation time, an OWLReasoner will load the axioms in the root ontology imports closure.  It will attach itself
 * as a listener to the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyManager} that manages the root ontology.
 * The reasoner will listen to any
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyChange}s and respond appropriately to them before answering any queries.
 * If the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode} of the reasoner (the answer to {@link #getBufferingMode()}
 * is {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode#NON_BUFFERING}) the ontology changes are processed by the reasoner
 * immediately so that any queries asked after the changes are answered with respect to the changed ontologies.
 * If the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode} of the reasoner is {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.BufferingMode#BUFFERING}
 * then ontology changes are stored in a buffer and are only taken into consideration when the buffer is flushed with
 * the {@link #flush()} method. When reasoning, axioms in the root ontology imports closure, minus the axioms returned
 * by the {@link #getPendingAxiomAdditions()} method, plus the axioms returned by the {@link #getPendingAxiomRemovals()}
 * are taken into consideration.
 * </p>
 * Note that there is no guarantee that the reasoner implementation will respond to changes in an incremental
 * (and efficient manner) manner.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Reasoner Axioms</h2>
 * The set of axioms that the reasoner takes into consideration when answering queries is known as the <i>set of
 * reasoner axioms</i>.  This corresponds the axioms in the imports closure of the root ontology plus the axioms
 * returned by the {@link #getPendingAxiomRemovals()} minus the axioms returned by {@link #getPendingAxiomAdditions()}
 * </p>
 * <h2>Nodes</h2>
 * The reasoner interface contains methods that return {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.NodeSet}s.  These are
 * sets of {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node}s.  A <code>Node</code> contains entities.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLClass&gt;</code>
 * of classes, each class in the node is equivalent to the other classes in the <code>Node</code> with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLObjectProperty&gt;</code> of object properties, each
 * object property in the <code>Node</code> is equivalent to the other object properties in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLDataProperty&gt;</code> of data properties, each data property
 * in the <code>Node</code> is equivalent to the other data properties in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLNamedIndividual&gt;</code> of named individuals, each individual in the node
 * is the same as the other individuals in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * <p/>
 * By abuse of notation, we say that a <code>NodeSet</code> "contains" an entity if that entity is contained in one
 * of the <code>Nodes</code> in the <code>NodeSet</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Hierarchies</h2>
 *
 * A hierachy (class hierachy, object property hierarchy, data property hierarchy) is viewed as a directed acyclic
 * graph (DAG) containing nodes connected via edges.  Each node in the hierarchy represents a set of entities that
 * are equivalent to each other.  Each hierarchy has a top node (see {@link Node#isTopNode()}) and a bottom node
 * (see {@link Node#isBottomNode()}).
 * </p>
 * The figure below shows an example class hierarchy.  Each box in the hierarchy represents a <code>Node</code>.  In
 * this case the top node contains <code>owl:Thing</code> and the bottom node contains <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * because the nodes in the hierarchy are <code>OWLClass</code> nodes.  In this case, class <code>G</code>
 * is equivalent to <code>owl:Thing</code> so it appears as an entity in the top node along with <code>owl:Thing</code>.
 * Similarly, class <code>K</code> is unsatisfiable, so it is equivalent to <code>owl:Nothing</code>, and therefore
 * appears in the bottom node containing <code>owl:Nothing</code>.  In this example, classes <code>A</code> and
 * <code>B</code> are equivalent so they appear in one node, also, classes <code>D</code> and <code>F</code> are
 * equivalent so they appear in one node.
 * </p>
 * Asking for the subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the a <code>NodeSet</code> containing the nodes that contain classes
 * that are strict subclasses of the specified class (expression). For example, asking for the subclasses of class <code>C</code>
 * returns the <code>NodeSet</code> <code>{E}</code> and
 * <code>{owl:Nothing, K}</code>.
 * </p>
 * Asking for the direct subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the <code>NodeSet</code> that
 * contains the nodes that contains classes that are direct subclasses of the specified class.  For example, asking for
 * the direct subclasses of class <code>A</code> returns the <code>NodeSet</code>
 * containing the nodes <code>{C}</code> and <code>{D, F}</code>.  Note that there are convenience methods on
 * {@link NodeSet} and {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node} that can be used to directly access the entities
 * in a <code>NodeSet</code> without having to iterate over the nodes and entities in a <code>NodeSet</code>. For
 * example, a "plain" set of classes contained inside the <code>Nodes</code> contained inside a <code>NodeSet</code>
 * can easily be obtained using the {@link NodeSet#getFlattened()} method.  In this case we could quickly obtain <code>{C,
 * D, F}</code> as the direct subclasses of <code>A</code> simply by using the
 * {@link #getSubClasses(org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLClassExpression, boolean)}} (with boolean=true) method on
 * <code>OWLReasoner</code> and then we could use the {@link NodeSet#getFlattened()} method on the retuned <code>NodeSet</code>.
 * </p>
 * Asking for equivalent classes of a class (expression) returns a <code>Node</code> that contains classes that are equivalent to
 * the class (expression) .  For example, asking for the equivalent classes of <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * (i.e. asking for the unsatisfiable classes) returns the <code>Node</code> <code>{owl:Nothing, K}</code>.

 * In what follows, an extension of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-syntax-20091027/">OWL 2 Functional Syntax</a>
 * is given in order to capture notions like a class being a "direct" subclass of another class.
 * <p/>
 *
 * <h3>StrictSubClassOf</h3>
 * <p>
 * Given two class expressions <code>CE1</code> and <code>CE2</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>, <code>CE1</code> is
 * a strict subclass of <code>CE2</code>, written <code>StrictSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)</code> if <code>O</code> entails
 * <code>SubClassOf(CE1 CE2)</code> and <code>O</code> does not entail <code>SubClassOf(CE2 CE1)</code>
 * <p/>
 *
 * <h3>DirectSubClassOf</h3>
 * <p>
 * Given two class expressions <code>CE1</code> and <code>CE2</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>,  <code>CE1</code>
 * is a <emph>direct</emph> subclass of <code>CE2</code>, written <code>DirectSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)</code>, with respect
 * to <code>O</code> if <code>O</code> entails <code>StrictSubClassOf(CE1 CE2)</code> and there is no class name
 * <code>C</code> in the signature of <code>O</code> such that <code>O</code> entails <code>StrictSubClassOf(CE1 C)</code>
 * and <code>O</code> entails <code>StrictSubClassOf(C CE2)</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>StrictSubObjectPropertyOf</h3>
 * <p>
 * Given two object property expressions <code>OPE1</code> and <code>OPE2</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>,
 * <code>OPE1</code> is a strict subproperty of <code>OPE2</code>, written <code>StrictSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)</code>
 * if <code>O</code> entails <code>SubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)</code> and <code>O</code> does not entail
 * <code>SubObjectPropertyOf(OPE2 OPE1)</code>
 * <p/>
 *
 *
 * <h3>DirectSubObjectPropertyOf</h3>
 * <p>
 * Given two object property expressions <code>OPE1</code> and <code>OPE2</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>,
 * <code>OPE1</code> is a <emph>direct</emph> subproperty of <code>OPE2</code>, written <code>DirectSubObjectPropertyOf(OPE1 OPE2)</code>,

 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>StrictSubDataPropertyOf</h3>
 * <p>

 * <code>DPE1</code> is a strict subproperty of <code>DPE2</code>, written <code>StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)</code>
 * if <code>O</code> entails <code>SubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)</code> and <code>O</code> does not entail
 * <code>SubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)</code>
 * <p/>
 *
 *
 * <h3>DirectSubDataPropertyOf</h3>
 * <p>
 * Given two data property expressions <code>DPE1</code> and <code>DPE2</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>,
 * <code>DPE1</code> is a <emph>direct</emph> subproperty of <code>DPE2</code>, written <code>DirectSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)</code>,
 * with respect to <code>O</code> if <code>O</code> entails <code>StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 DPE2)</code> and
 * there is no data property name <code>P</code> in the signature of <code>O</code> such that <code>O</code> entails
 * <code>StrictSubDataPropertyOf(DPE1 P)</code> and <code>O</code> entails <code>StrictSubDataPropertyOf(P DPE2)</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>DirectClassAssertion</h3>
 *
 * Given an individual <code>j</code> and a class expression <code>CE</code> and an ontology <code>O</code>, <code>CE</code>

 * <code>ClassAssertion(CE j)</code> and there is no class name <code>C</code> in the signature of <code>O</code>
 * such that <code>O</code> entails <code>ClassAssertion(C j)</code> and <code>O</code> entails
 * <code>StrictSubClassOf(C CE)</code>.
 *
 * <h3>ObjectPropertyComplementOf</h3>
 *
 * Given an object property expression <code>pe</code>, the object property complement of <code>pe</code> is written
 * as <code>ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code>.  The interpretation of <code>ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code>
 * is equal to the interpretation of <code>owl:topObjectProperty</code>
 * minus the interpretation of <code>pe</code>. In other words, <code>ObjectPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code> is the
 * set of pairs of individuals that are not in <code>pe</code>.
 *
 *
 * <h3>DataPropertyComplementOf</h3>
 *
 * Given a data property expression <code>pe</code>, the data property complement of <code>pe</code> is written
 * as <code>DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code>.  The interpretation of <code>DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code>
 * is equal to the interpretation of <code>owl:topDataProperty</code>
 * minus the interpretation of <code>pe</code>. In other words, <code>DataPropertyComplementOf(pe)</code> is the
 * set of pairs of individual and literals that are not in <code>pe</code>.
 *
 * <h3 id="spe">Simplified Object Property Expression</h3>
 *
 * A simplified object property expression is either a named property <code>P</code>, or an object inverse property of the form
 * <code>ObjectInverseOf(P)</code> where <code>P</code> is a named property.  In other words, there is no nesting
 * of <code>ObjectInverseOf</code> operators.
 *
 *
