 *
 * <h3>Nodes in hierarchies</h3>
 * In the OWL API, a reasoner treats a class hierarchy, an object property hierarchy or a data property hierarchy
 * as a hierarchy (directed acyclic graph - DAG) of <code>Nodes</code>.  Each node contains entities that are equivalent
 * to each other.  A hierarchy contains a <i>top node</i>, which is the ancestor of all nodes in the hierarchy, and
 * a <i>bottom node</i> which is the descendant of all nodes in the hierarchy.
 * </p>
 * In a class hierarchy, the nodes contain <code>OWLClass</code> objects.  The top node contains <code>owl:Thing</code> (and
 * any other named classes that are equivalent to <code>owl:Thing</code>).
 * The bottom node contains <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * (and any other named classes that are equivalent to <code>owl:Nothing</code> - these classes are <i>unsatisfiable</i>
 * classes).
 * </p>
 * In an object property hierarchy, the nodes contain <code>OWLObjectProperty</code> objects.  The top node contains
 * <code>owl:topObjectProperty</code> (and any other named object properties that are equivalent to <code>owl:topObjectProperty</code>).
 * The bottom node contains <code>owl:bottomObjectProperty</code>
 * (and any other named object properties that are equivalent to <code>owl:bottomObjectProperty</code>).
 * </p>
 * In a data property hierarchy, the nodes contain <code>OWLDataProperty</code> objects.  The top node contains
 * <code>owl:topDataProperty</code> (and any other data properties that are equivalent to <code>owl:topDataProperty</code>).
 * The bottom node contains <code>owl:bottomDataProperty</code>
 * (and any other data properties that are equivalent to <code>owl:bottomDataProperty</code>).
 *
 * <h4>Class Hierarchy Example</h4>
 * The figure below shows an example class hierarchy.  Each box in the hierarchy represents a <code>Node</code>.  In
 * this case the top node contains <code>owl:Thing</code> and the bottom node contains <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * because the nodes in the hierarchy are <code>OWLClass</code> nodes.  In this case, class <code>G</code>
 * is equivalent to <code>owl:Thing</code> so it appears as an entity in the top node. Similarly, class <code>K</code>
 * is unsatisfiable, so it is equivalent to <code>owl:Nothing</code> and therefore appears in the bottom node containing
 * <code>owl:Nothing</code>.
 * </p>
